QGIS plugin to export your project to an OpenLayers or Leaflet webmap.</br>
It replicates as many aspects of the project as it can, including layers, extent and styles (including categorized and graduated).</br>
No server-side software required.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In QGIS, select <code>Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>or:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download and unzip this repo to your QGIS plugins directory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Prepare your map as far as possible in QGIS, as you want it to appear in
your webmap. Specific tasks you can carry out to improve your webmap include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set your project title, and background and highlight colours in 
        <code>Project > Project Properties...</code></li>
    <li>Give your layers human-friendly names in the <code>Layers Panel</code>
    </li>
    <li>Give your layer columns human friendly names via <code>Layer > Properties > Fields > Alias</code></li>
    <li>Hide the columns you don't want to appear in your popups by changing
        their Edit widget to "Hidden"</li>
    <li>If any of your fields contain image filenames, change their Edit
        widget to "Photo" to have the images appear in popups</li>
    <li>Style your layers, and set their scale-dependent visibility, if
        required</li>
</ul>
<p>Run qgis2web from the Web menu, or via its icon. If required, choose a
basemap from the list below the preview pane, and click "Update preview".
CTRL/CMD-click for multiple basemaps or to deselect a basemap.</p>
<p>The top-left pane lets you set options for each layer in your map. The
bottom-left pane sets overall options for your project. All options are written
to your QGIS project, so save your project if you want to keep these settings.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>qgis2web is fundamentally a merge of Victor Olaya's qgis-ol3 and Riccardo
Klinger's qgis2leaf. It would not exist without their work. Thank you,
gentlemen. Thanks are also very much due to Paolo Cavallini, who suggested
and supported the merge.</p>
